Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) methods implementation in Python

## Functions list:

ssa - Singular Spectrum decomposition for a time series

inv_ssa - Inverted SS transformation (series reconstruction)

ssa_predict - Making series data prediction based on SSA

ssa_cutoff_order - Method for searching for the best cutoff for dimensions number

ssaview - Visualising tools for singular spectrum analysis

Small example of application SSA for price series forecasting can be found [here](https://github.com/dmarienko/chaos/blob/master/SSA_for_stock_prices_prediction.ipynb)
